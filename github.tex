GitHub is a web platform for collaboration using git, which is a version control system. 
We used this system to allow several people work on the same project at the same time without overwriting each others changes.

For some of our dependencies (Sphinx, OpenDial) we used git submodules to include them into our project. 
This gave us the possibility to adapt the original code for our purposes if necessary.
In order to download these dependencies when you clone the repository, you must therefore execute
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
git clone https://github.com/EllaVator/EllaVator.git --recursive
\end{lstlisting}
or init and update all of the subprojects individually.

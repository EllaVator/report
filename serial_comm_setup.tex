Raspberri Pi 2 should be connected to the elevator via DE-9 type serial port.
After numerous of unsuccessful attempts to connect Raspi to the serial port via its GPIO pins, we decided to buy a USB to serial converter. 
The new converter worked fine out-of-the-box.
We successfully sent test signals via serial port from Raspi to desktop PC and vice verse.
After running several tests between Raspi and desktop PC we decided to test serial connection to the elevator.

We managed to send a signal to the elevator via serial port however the elevator was able to move only to one specific floor (0.5 which corresponds to 1 floor).
The signal was interpreted by the elevator as a command to move to floor 1.
We suspect that this is due to insufficient power (5V) of Raspi USB to serial connector.
The signal gets garbled upon transmission.
We believe that if we manage to boost the serial port power up to 12V the connection should stabilize and work correctly.
